# Investigating the Efficacy of Statistical, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning Approaches in Steel Stock Price Prediction

## Abstract
This study investigates the efficacy of various algorithms for time series analysis on steel stock price data. We employ a dataset encompassing the prices of Hoa Phat Group, Hoa Sen Group, and Nam Kim Group from the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). The employed algorithms include Linear Regression, ARIMA, VARMA, Bagging with RNN, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with variants LSTM and GRU, and Residual Networks (ResNet). The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). This research aims to assess the effectiveness of these algorithms in capturing the inherent patterns within steel stock price time series data. The findings contribute to the development of time series analysis methodologies in the steel sector, providing valuable insights for further research on price prediction models.
